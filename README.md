## Features

### Navbar

The navigation bar gives you access to the activities page as well as an opportunity to either login with a previously created account or create an account via the sign up option.


The navigation bar once you are logged in gives you the opportunity to add your own activities as well as log out of your account.


### Sign Up Page

The sign up page allows you to create an account by providing a username and password for authentication. Creating an account gives you access to extra functionality such as the ability to create, edit, and delete your own activities and comment on the activities of others.

### Login Page

As with the sign up page, the login page allows previously registered users to access the extra functionality that having an account provides.

### Activities Page

This page presents an ordered and paginated list of activities posted by users. Visible is the title and excerpt of the activity. These activities are public but an account must be created to leave a comment or create your own activities.

### Activity Detail Page

The activity detail page presents the selected activtiy in detail including its title, excerpt, content and comments left by users.

### Create Activity Page

The create activity page displays a form where you can enter a title, excerpt and the content of your activity.

### Create Comment Page

The create comment page is shown as a form where you can leave a comment on the selected post.

### Edit Activity Page

The edit activity page displays your activity as a form, pre-populated with the details and content previously provided so that you can edit your post.

### Delete Activity Page

The delete activity page displays a warning (defensive programming) to ensure that you are certain of your choice to delete the chosen activity and are aware of the consequences.

## Features Left To Implement

Add a calendar so that users can organise meet ups to exercise or explore nature in a group setting. This adds to the social aspect of this web application and encourages users to engage with others during their activities.
